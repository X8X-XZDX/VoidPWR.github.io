title: IRC migration

After the recent events regarding freenode IRC ownership, the upstream Void
project is moving IRC networks and so are we.

We have settled for the OFTC network (https://oftc.net). Since OFTC is a long
time host for the Debian project without any incidents and the Alpine Linux
project has also migrated there, we consider this a stable new home for the
distribution.

See you there!
