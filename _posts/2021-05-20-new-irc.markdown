title: IRC migration

After the recent events regarding freenode IRC ownership, we are moving IRC
networks.

We have settled for the OFTC network (https://oftc.net), with the same name
as before (i.e. `#voidlinux-ppc`). Since OFTC is a long time host for the
Debian project without any incidents and the Alpine Linux project has also
migrated there, we consider this a stable new home for the distribution.

The upstream Void project has not yet reached a consensus, but you should
be expecting some news on that front very soon as well.

See you there!
