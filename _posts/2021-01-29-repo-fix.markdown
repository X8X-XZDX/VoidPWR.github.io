title: What to do if a recent update removed your package repo access
layout: post
---

If you updated on the 28th January or early 29th January, you probably got
an update to `xbps 0.59.1_3`. After doing this update, you might have noticed
that repo syncing no longer works, so you will not be getting any more updates.

This is because of an accident that happened when rebasing `void-ppc`'s
`void-packages` fork changes. It is fixed in `xbps 0.59.1_4` uploaded as
of 29th January 14:30 CET, but it will not fix things for those who updated
during the narrow window of breakage.

In order to unbreak your updates manually, go to `/usr/share/xbps.d` and
edit your `00-repository-main.conf`. The contents of the file should be just
a URL. Change it from something like:

```
https://auto.voidlinux-ppc.org/...
```

to

```
repository=https://auto.voidlinux-ppc.org/...
```

That is, you just have to prepend `repository=` to the URL. After that, you
can sync again, update your `xbps` again, and then you should be able to
install updates normally again.
